Added connection timeout for outgoing web requests (e.g. for script update checks)
Added some checks of RAM, SWAP and DISK parsing functions when any errors happens
Reworked the way how RAM and SWAP information gets read from the system (not OS language-dependend anymore)
Changed: Calculate md5 hash of installed TS3 plugin even if the bot plugin does not exist in the bot directory
Fixed: Reading out RAM and SWAP-data was not possible when the operating system had any other language than english
Fixed: Retrieving permissions of the sinusbot init.d script did not work on systems with any other language than english
Known issue: Getting DISK data on OpenVZ machines and non-english systems may still not work. Not critical, fix may be released in the future.
